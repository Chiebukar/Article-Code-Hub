# Machine Learning pipelines

Pipelines are useful for automating the iterative processes of data transformation and building estimators. 
They offer efficient methods to automatically apply specific or diverse transformations to particular or numerous input features.
Python libraries such as Sklearn and SkLearn-Pandas provide convenient methods to define and execute Machine Learning pipelines.
In this article, we successfully developed a pipeline to automate the machine learning workflow such that it can also be used to transform other data streams with 
similar structures.

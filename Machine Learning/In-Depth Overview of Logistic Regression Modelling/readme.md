# In-Depth Overview of Logistic Regression
In this article, we provided an in-depth overview of logistic regression modelling, covering key concepts essential for data scientists. We began by understanding the problem logistic regression aims to solve, specifically classification tasks. We looked into the theoretical foundations of logistic regression, exploring the logistic function and how it helps predict probabilities for binary and multiclass classification problems.

We walked through a simple example and implemented logistic regression from scratch using Python, highlighting the underlying mathematical principles. Additionally, we discussed various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix, which are crucial for assessing the performance of classification models. Finally, we demonstrated a practical application using the Iris dataset and the Scikit-Learn library, visualizing decision boundaries and interpreting the results.
